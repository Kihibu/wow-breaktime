BreakTime V 2.4.1.0 for World of Warcraft
Author: Akarficus (Hekita of Dawnbringer)

UPDATE: You can now reset the timer in the options menu or by typing /bkt resetTimer.

This mod tells you when to take a break much like Guild Wars and Lineage 2 did. You can output a message on the screen or in the chat window. 
In addition, you can also associate a sound to play when the message is displayed. The message can be set to go off every 5 minutes up to 2 hours. 
If you switch characters this mod will not save the previous session's online time. If I find a suitable way to make this work correctly I will put this in but until then this will have to do.

To install just copy the directory into your World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns folder.

This is a simple mod but I felt WoW needed this for those people who need to take a break every so often and they forget to do so. So enjoy! 
I'm always open to suggestions so feel free to contact me if you have any.
